* Installation

Git-clone the repository to your Nyxt extension directory. This
directory is typically located at =~/.local/share/nyxt/extensions=
#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/logoraz/nx-micros ~/.local/share/nyxt/extensions/nx-micros
#+end_src

After you've added nx-micros to a place that Nyxt can find it, it is
necessary to load it in your init file. To do this, it suffices to add
the following:

#+NAME: add nx-micros to init
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  ,#+nyxt-2
  (asdf:load-system :nx-micros)
  ,#+ (or nyxt-3 nyxt-4)
  (nyxt:define-nyxt-user-system-and-load "nyxt-user/nx-micros-proxy"
                                         :description "This proxy system saves us if nx-micros fails to load.
  Otherwise it will break all the config loading."
                                         :depends-on ("nx-micros"))
#+END_SRC

Now, upon starting Nyxt, you can connect Nyxt to Lem via `start-micros` command starting a swank server.
