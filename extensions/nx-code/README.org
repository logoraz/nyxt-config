* Installation

Git-clone the repository to your Nyxt extension directory. This
directory is typically located at =~/.local/share/nyxt/extensions=
#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/logoraz/nx-code ~/.local/share/nyxt/extensions/nx-code
#+end_src

After you've added nx-code to a place that Nyxt can find it, it is
necessary to load it in your init file. To do this, it suffices to add
the following:

#+NAME: add nx-code to init
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (define-nyxt-user-system-and-load "nyxt-user/nx-micros-proxy"
    :description "This proxy system saves us if nx-micros fails to load.
  Otherwise it will break all the config loading."
    :depends-on ("nx-code"))
#+END_SRC

Now, upon starting Nyxt, you can enjoy a modern advanced Emacs-like editor/IDE experience optimized for Common Lisp hacking!
